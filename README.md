# Discache : Distributed LRU Cache

Discache, is a powerfull, but simple LRU cache in golang. Using TCP and binary a as transporter which makes it very profomant.

## Client
A Go client for connecting to an LRU cache server over TCP. This client allows users to perform Get and Put operations on the cache, handling network communication and TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries.

### Features
- Get: Retrieve a value by its key.
- Put: Store a value with a specified TTL.
- Connection Management: Establishes and closes TCP connections.
- Error Handling: Returns detailed error messages for failed operations.

### Setup and Installation
- Prerequisites: Make sure you have Go installed.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Build the Client:

```bash
go build -o lru_client client.go
```
### Usage
#### Initialize the Client
To create a new client instance, use New with the server endpoint and optional configurations:

```go
import "github.com/dhyanio/discache/client"

func main() {
    endpoint := "localhost:8080"
    opts := client.Options{}
    cacheClient, err := client.New(endpoint, opts)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to cache server: %v", err)
    }
    defer cacheClient.Close()
}

```

#### Using Get and Put Methods
`Put` a key-value pair into the cache with a specified TTL (in seconds):

```go
key := []byte("exampleKey")
value := []byte("exampleValue")
ttl := 60 // TTL in seconds

err := cacheClient.Put(context.Background(), key, value, ttl)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to put key: %v", err)
}
```

`Get` a value by key:

```go
value, err := cacheClient.Get(context.Background(), key)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to get key: %v", err)
} else {
    log.Printf("Value: %s", string(value))
}
```
#### Close the Client
Always close the connection when you're done:

```go
defer cacheClient.Close()
```

### Error Handling
Errors returned by `Get` and `Put` methods include:

- `Key Not Found`: if the key doesnâ€™t exist.
- `Connection Errors`: issues in TCP communication with the server.
- `Non-OK Status`: unexpected server responses.

### Dependencies
This project requires a transport package to handle command structure and response parsing.
